# Welcome to the Jaspersoft Analytics Project

This project forms part of the delivery of a learning management system for our global retail network learning and development operation.

## Product Vision

To enable global retail network learning and development to make better decisions faster by bringing them timely, actionable data around the operation's business processes.

## Product Strategy

### Ad Hoc Query

To enable users to ask their own questions of the data, without relying on IT to create a report. In particular, we aim to provide a robust semantic layer to allow users to navigate available data sources.

### Data Quality

To improve data quality in the learning management system to enable users to better manage and correct data, and ensure the reporting and analytics solution provides accurate, consistent, and precise information and analysis to support decision making.

### Dashboards

To provide quick high-level summary of business performance with the ability to drill down to lower-level details within reason, and to refresh in line with key performance targets.

### Reports

To provide lightweight analysis and present data in a static tabular or pivot format. To enable users to group, sort, and filter the data using parameters and/or being able to sub-filter the data set.
